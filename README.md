# ASL Alphabet Recognition App

This project recognizes American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet hand signs from images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow/Keras and a simple Gradio web UI.

## Features

- CNN model trained on the ASL alphabet dataset (A–Z and special characters).  
- Data preparation script to load, resize and split images into train/validation/test sets.  
- Inference script to predict a single image from the command line.  
- Gradio app to upload an image and view the top predicted letters.

## Tech stack

- Python, NumPy  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Pillow  
- Gradio
